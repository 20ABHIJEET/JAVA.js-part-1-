# JAVA.js-part-1-
Welcome to my first GitHub repository! I’m Abhijit Raut, and here you’ll find my initial exploration into JavaScript fundamentals.
This project marks my first step into JavaScript. It’s an easy-to-understand guide and codebase for beginners looking to grasp the building blocks of JS and for me to practice sharing meaningful code.
I'd love your feedback, questions, or suggestions—feel free to open an issue or drop a star ⭐️ if you found it helpful!
Thanks for visiting—Happy Coding!
